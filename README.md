# wc_Tool
This project involves creating a simple command line based word/line/byte/character count tool.
The use has to pass the name of the file to test and the option for operation as "ccwc -f name_of_file.txt" 
-f are the flags : -l -> Count the lines in the files
                   -c -> Count the bytes
                   -w -> Count the words
The ccwc.bat file when ran in the cmd calls the run.bat file (2 arguments have to be passed from the cmd).
The run.bat calls the .exe file of code.cpp
